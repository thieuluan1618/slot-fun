# Task Completion Checklist

## After Making Code Changes

### 1. Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Run linting to check code style
ng lint
```
- Fix any linting errors or warnings
- Ensure code follows project conventions

### 2. Git Workflow
```bash
# Check status
git status

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with meaningful message
git commit -m "descriptive message"
- Don't add extra information

# Push to appropriate branch
git push origin develop  # or feature branch
```

### 3. For Deployment-Ready Changes
- Create pull request to `main` branch
- Merge triggers automatic Netlify deployment
- Monitor deployment at https://slot-fun-game.netlify.app/

- Verify smooth PIXI.js animations
- Test with throttled network connections

## Security Checks
- No console.log statements in production code
- Validate API endpoints are using HTTPS
- Check that no sensitive data is exposed in client-side code
- Verify JWT token handling in auth service
